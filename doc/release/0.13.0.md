## Notes about new/updated Features

### Preimages enabling
A new property was added to the config file for enabling the storage of preimages. Preimages contain the account 
addresses that are not usually saved in the state trie. Enabling preimages is a pre-requirement for executing a state dump.

How to specify it: 
- inside the config file, add a property like this inside the *evmStateDump* section:

  enabled = "true"

###   New zen_dump rpc method
This method executes a dump on a json file of the EVM state. It takes 2 input parameters:
- blockHashOrNumber: hash or height of the block where the dump needs to be executed
- fileName: fully-qualified name of the json file where the dump will be saved

It can be called only on nodes where preimages were enabled.
