## Notes about new/updated Features

### Preimages enabling
A new property was added to the config file for enabling the storage of preimages. Preimages contain the account 
addresses that are not usually saved in the state trie. Enabling preimages is a pre-requirement for executing a state dump.

How to specify it: 
- inside the config file, add a property like this inside the *evmStateDump* section:

  enabled = "true"
