## Notes about new/updated Features

### Support for multisg MC addresses in ZenDAO Native Smart Contract

In ZenDAO Native Smart Contract, now MC multisig addresses can be associated to a SC address as any other MC transparent address.

### Support for ZenIP 42203 & ZenIP 42206

The new support for ZenIP 42203 & ZenIP 42206 will introduce the following two features:

- possibility to execute forward transfers from the Mainchain directly to smart contract addresses
- possibility to increment the forgers' rewards by executing a transfer (standard EOA or forward transfer) to the "special" address 0x000000000000000000003333333333333333333.
  - The amount of ZEN collected by the address will be redistributed to each forger proportionally to the number of blocks forged within the latest "distribution window"
  - The "distribution window" starts from the previous "distribution window" end. In the case of the 1st distribution, it starts from the hardfork introduced with this version.
  - The "distribution window" ends when both the following conditions are met:
    - the chain reaches a "Withdrawal epoch end"
    - the balance of "special address" is greater than zero

## Bug Fixes
- Forger Stake native smart contract: OpenStakeForgerList function can now be invoked using the ABI-compliant signature.

  In previous versions, the method signature was incorrectly missing a closing parenthesis at the end:
  ```
  openStakeForgerList(uint32,bytes32,bytes32
  ```
  instead of
  ```
  openStakeForgerList(uint32,bytes32,bytes32)
  ```

  For backward compatibility, the old signature is anyway still valid.
