## Notes about new/updated Features

### New configuration flag history.resetModifiersStatus

A new (optional) flag is available in the configuration file:

```
sparkz {
  history {
    resetModifiersStatus = true
  }
}
```
The deafalut setting is = false, and is the correct configuration for standard behaviour.
Setting it to 'true' will force the node to re-evaluate all the blocks received from other peers, even if they were previously marked as invalid/incorrect.
This configuration can be used if a node was not updated on-time before a mandatory hard-fork, and after the fork is stuck in a separate chain. In such this case, updating the node with the correct version will not be enough to having it re-join the longest chain, because the modifiers status cache will still contain some blocks marked as invalid. 
The suggested procedure in this situation is:
- update the node with the correct version
- set this flag to true
- restart the node: it should reach the longest chain tip
- stop again the node and remove the flag, to restore the default configuration.
