## Notes about new/updated Features

### Native Smart Contracts <> EVM Smart Contracts Interoperability
It is now possible for an EVM Smart Contract to invoke a Native Smart Contract function and vice-versa. 
The EVM Smart Contract can invoke a Native Smart Contract function using the following low-level functions:
- `staticcall`
- `call`

`delegatecall` and `callcode` cannot be used instead, they will return an error in case they are used with Native
Smart Contracts.
